# Change GitHub users in Visual Studio Code
Here is a script that allows you to change GitHub users in Visual Studio Code.

To use this script, save it as a Python file (e.g. `change_github_user.py`) and run it in a terminal. You will be prompted to enter the new GitHub user name and mail. Once you have entered theuser name and mail, Visual Studio Code will be restarted with the new user settings.

Note that this script will change the global Git user settings. If you are working on multiple projects that use different GitHub accounts, you may want to change the Git user settings on a per-project basis instead. To do this, you can use the `git config` command in the root directory of each project.
